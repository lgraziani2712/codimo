## HEAD

- 🔥 [2017-04-27] `blockly/executorGenerator`: complete v1.0.1.
  - Refactor private function. This fix an error occurred when multiple blocks added a `BlockExecutor` with the same name.
  - Add snapshot test for the resultant code.
- 🔥 [2017-04-27] `blockly/components`: remove JS action executors.
  - 🔥 One step towards removing this section completely. Blockly components are going to be JSON data.
  - 🐛 TEMPORARY: extracted each component's name into a new constant: `blockly/constants.blockNames`.
  - 🐛 Components' name now must follows the Blockly standard: `lower_underscore`.
- 🚀 [2017-04-27] `blockly/executorGenerator`: complete v1.0.0.
  - This function is responsible for generating the executor object, who is in charge of running the resultant blockly code. Its API is extremly simple.
- 🚀 [2017-04-25] `engine/components/blockGenerator`: update generator firm.
- ⚙ [2017-04-25] `engine/containers/mazeGenerator`: refactor.
  - 🚀 Added new props to the maze metadata structure.
  - 🔥 Remove unnecessary information related to the maze metadata.
- ⚙ [2017-04-25] `engine/containers/numericLineGenerator`: refactor.
  - ⚙ Update generator firm. Adds `size` prop for the box size.
- ⚙ [2017-04-25] `engine/containers/lineGenerator`: refactor.
  - Follows the curry policy for private props.
  - ⚙ Update generator firm. Adds `size` prop for the box size.
  - 🔥 Remove unnecessary information related to the maze metadata.
- ⚙ [2017-04-25] `engine/containers/numberGenerator`: refactor.
  - Follows the curry policy for private props.
  - ⚙ Update generator firm. Adds `size` prop for the box size.
  - 🔥 Remove unnecessary information related to the maze metadata.
- 🚀 [2017-04-24] `engine/containers/gameGenerator`: complete the first version of the maze game generator!
  - It receives a mazeData, and generates everything. This object will be the bridge between pixi.js and blockly.
  - Follows the curry policy for private props.
- ⚙ [2017-04-24] `engine/components/numericLineGenerator`: refactor to match `lineGenerator` refactor and inner improvements:
  - 🔥 Remove `line` from public props. This follows the curry policy for private props.
  - 🚀 Add type definition.
- ⚙ [2017-04-24] `engine/components/numericLineGenerator/lineGenerator`: update.
  - ⚙ Update generator firm. It receives only an array of numbers and nulls representing each position of the line. Nulls values are expected to be the numbers the user will move around the maze.
  - 🚀 Add type definition.
- ⚙ [2017-04-24] `engine/components/mazeGenerator`: update generator firm.
  - 🚀 New parameter: `mazeData`.
  - `MazeData.json` -> `mazeData.json` and is going to be deleted. Its structure is morphing into something useful. It contains the meta information necessary to generate a new game.
- ⚙ [2017-04-24] `engine/components/numericLineGenerator`: update generator firm to match `lineGenerator`.
- ⚙ [2017-04-24] `engine/components/numericLineGenerator/lineGenerator`: update generator firm.
  - 🚀 New parameter: `numbers`. Map of [position, number].
- ⚙ [2017-04-24] `engine/components/numberGenerator`: add `staticNumberGenerator` for non animated numbers.
- ⚙ [2017-04-23] `engine/components/numericLineGenerator/lineGenerator`: update `receiveNumberAtPosition`. Now follows the promised animations rule.
- ⚙ [2017-04-23] `engine/components/numberGenerator`: update `updatePosition`.
  - NOW: returns a `Promise<void>`. When the animation completes, resolves the promise.
- ⚙ [2017-04-23] `engine/components/mazeGenerator`: update `MazeData.json` structure. Now it also contains the exit positions.
- [2017-04-19] `engine/components/numericLineGenerator/lineGenerator`:
  - 🐛 Fix how are defined each number square. This allow to add a number easly without the need to calculate any coordinate. Is the original expected behavior.
  - 🚀 Change firm. Instead of returning a `Container`, it follows the actual standard and returns an object that contains a `view` and another public properties.
  - 🚀 Add one property:
    - `receiveNumberAtPosition`: a function to add a `number` into an square at an specific `position`.
- [2017-04-19] `engine/components/numericLineGenerator`:
  - 🐛 Fix how children are setted.
  - 🚀 Change firm. Instead of returning a `Container`, it follows the actual standard and returns an object that contains a `view` and another public properties.
  - 🚀 Add two properties:
    - `line`: it contains the visible numbers.
    - `receiveNumberAtPosition`: a function to add a number to the `line`.
- 🚀 [2017-04-02] `engine/components/numericLineGenerator`: add first version.
- 🚀 [2017-04-02] `engine/components/numberGenerator`: add GSAP TweenLite for movement animation.
- ⚙ [2017-03-31] `test/PixiWrapper`: extract it from `engine/components/mazeGenerator.stories`. It's a little more generical!
- ⚙ [2017-03-31] `engine/components/Block -> blockGenerator`: now it has one curry function to receive the representation color and then returns the blockGenerator specifically for that color. In the near future it will receive a texture instead of a color.
- ⚙ [2017-03-31] `engine/components/Maze -> mazeGenerator`: extract the implementation that was done in the story. Then refactore it for the new blockGenerator implementation.
- 🚀 [2017-03-31] `engine/components/numberGenerator`: finish the first version of the game's actor object.
- 🚀 [2017-03-31] `flow-typed/pixi_v4.x.x`: finish the first version of the PixiJS' type definition.
- [2017-03-28] `engine/components/{Block|Maze}`: first version of unit elements of a Maze. Add one story for unit development. PixiJS ❤ ReactStoryBook.
- [2017-03-27] `engine/helpers/assetLoader`: create first version. It has a decent type definition.
- [2017-02-14] Add authorship to every file.
- [2017-02-14] `blockly/components/ActionContainer`: add block's container. Also make it work with its children.
- [2017-02-13] `blockly/components`: add first blocks.
- [2017-02-13] `components/BlocklyApp`: it's the React component in charge of making Blockly work.
